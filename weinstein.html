        After some cringe naive (ontological) realists takes on and some literal misinterpretation of his works, I felt compelled to write about Weinstein's works on mathematical physics, in three parts. This first part will be all about canonical geometric quantization.

            Geometric Quantization

        <div class="heading-space"></div>
        

        <p>
            In geometric quantization, the goal to be achieved is to find a quantization map \(Q: C^\infty(M) \rightarrow \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{H})\) such that it satisfies the Dirac's quantization conditions, namely
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> 
                \(Q_{f_1 + f_2} = Q_{f_1} + Q_{f_2} \; \text{and} \; Q_{cf_1} = c Q_{f_1}, \; \text{given} \; c \in \mathbb{R}\);
            </li>
            <li>
                \( Q_1  = \text{id}_\mathcal{H} \);
            </li>
            <li>
                \(Q_{\bar{f}} = (Q_f)^*\);
            </li>
            <li>
                \( [Q_f, Q_g] = -i \hbar Q_{\{f,g\}} \);
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f_1,...,f_n \; \text{complete} \Rightarrow Q_{f_1}...Q_{f_n} \; \text{complete}\).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            However, it is not possible, at least not in this context; the best we can do is to define Q such that it satisfies the first four conditions. What his means is that in what follows, \(Q\) will never satisfy such condition, but the

            attempt to do so will return some interesting results. That being said, given a sympletic manifold \((M, \omega)\), it's quantization starts by the step known as prequantization. To do so, we start by defining a complex line bundle over \(M\), as follows:
        </p>

        <div class="definition" text='Complex Line Bundle'>

            Let \((M, \omega)\) be a sympletic manifold. The pair \((L, \nabla)\), given \(\sigma_\alpha: U_\alpha \rightarrow M\) a section of \(L\) and 
            \[
            (\nabla_X \sigma)_\alpha = X(\sigma_\alpha) - \frac{i}{\hbar} \theta_\alpha(X)\sigma_\alpha
            \]
            \(\forall X \in \mathfrak{X}_\mathbb{C}(M)\), is defined as a complex line bundle over \(M\).
        </div>

        <p>
            Next, we define the condition on which a manifold can possess a prequantum line bundle, in other words, the condition for a manifold M to be quantizable. This conditions is called Weil integrality condition, given by:
        </p>

        <div class="theorem" text='Wein Integrability Condition'>
            Let \((M, \omega)\)$ be a symplectic manifold. Then there exists a prequantum line bundle if and only if for every closed 2-dimensional submanifold \(\Sigma\) of \(M\) we have
            \begin{equation}
              \int_\Sigma \omega \in 2\pi\hbar\mathbb{Z}
            \end{equation}
            i.e. \([\omega] \in H^2(M, 2\pi\hbar\mathbb{Z})\).
        </div>

        <p>
            If that conditions holds for a manifold M, then it can be characterized as the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}^{\text{pre}} = L^2(L)\) and we can define the first ingredient on the recipe for construct \(Q\) — the prequantization map —, as:

            \[
            P_f \doteq  - i \hbar \nabla_{X_f} + f
            \]

            As it is, \(P_{f}\) satifies the first four Dirac's quantization conditions. In a attempt for it to satisfy the fifth one, we introduct two concepts: the polarization and the half-form. A polarization' goal is to select one half of the states in our Hilbert space, by selecting at

            every point \(p \in M\) half of the directions in the tangent space \(T_p M\) and asking the sections of the line bundle that is comprising our Hilbert space to be constant along these directions. The collection of these directions for a point \(p\) is the

            space \(\mathcal{P}_p \subset T_p M\), such that \(\mathcal{P} = \bigcup_{p \in M} \mathcal{P}_p\). \(\mathcal{P}\) must satisfy the polarization condition \(\nabla_X \sigma = 0\), for all \(X \in \Gamma(P)\), which implies that:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                For all \(X, Y \in \Gamma(P)\), the Lie bracket \([X,Y] \in \Gamma(P)\) - we say that \(\mathcal{P}\) is involutive;
            </li>
            <li>
                For all \(p \in M\), \(\mathcal{P}_p \subset T_p M\) is lagrangian. In other words, \(\mathcal{P}\) is lagrangian.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            So, in the end, our polarization \(\mathcal{P}\)  is just a involutive lagrangian subbundle of TM. However, it is usual to extend \(\mathcal{P}\)  by adding complex directions to it, such that it is now a subbundle of \(T_p M \otimes \mathbb{C} = (TM)_\mathbb{C}\), instead of \(TM\).

            The half-form \(]delta_p\) is introducted to compensate for a problem with real polarizations, where the space of these polarizations, \(\Gamma(\mathcal{P})\), was often empty. So, using \(\delta_p\) we define a new line bundle \(L_p = L \otimes \delta_p\) such that the

            product of two sections is naturally a volume form on the quotient. A mathematical rigorously discussion about the half-forms (and their theoretical construction in this context) would be too extensive, so I will leave it as it is. Take all about it for granted.

            That said, the sections of these bundles are called P-wave functions if they satisfy:
        </p>

        <div class="definition" text="P-Wave">
            Suppose we have a symplectic manifold \((M,\omega)\) with prequantum line bundle \((L,\nabla,\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)\), a polarization \(P\) and a half-form bundle \(\delta_{P}\). Let \(L_{P}=L\otimes\delta_{P}\). A section \(\tilde{\sigma}=\sigma\otimes\psi\in\Gamma(L_{P})\) is called a \(\textit{\(P\)-wave function}\) if for all \(X\in\Gamma(P)\)

            \[
            (\nabla_{X} + \nabla^{\delta_{P}}_{X})(\tilde{s}) = \nabla_{X}\sigma \otimes \psi + \sigma \otimes \nabla^{\delta_{P}}_{X}\psi = 0.
            \] 
        </div>

        <p>
            In other terms, a P-wave functions is a polarized section of \(L_p\) and, in a sense, they compose a refinement of the concept of well known square-integrable wave functions \(\psi \in L^2(\mathbb{C})\), i.e., the traditional wave functions as exposed in quantum mechanics courses. To see how the product of two sections defines a volume

            you have to note (or verify) that \(\langle \tilde{\sigma}_1, \tilde{\sigma}_2 \rangle_{L_p} = \langle \sigma_1, \sigma_2 \rangle (\varphi_1, \varphi_2) \) is invariant under the flow of any vector field \(X \in \Gamma(P)\), and therefore defines a volume form on \(Q = \frac{M}{D}\). Despite that efforts, \(P\) still don't satisfy the fifth Dirac's quantization condition, but

            that allow us to define a new and more appropriate Hilbert space for simply connected leaves, as \(\mathcal{H} = L^2(\Gamma_p(L_p))\), i.e., as the completion of \(\Gamma_p(L_p)\). When treating non-simply connected leaves, we need to introduced yet another new concept: the cohomological wave functions.

            In general, given \(\nabla\) a flat connection on a vector bundle \(E\), we can define a complex form as \(\Omega^*(M,E) = \Gamma(\Lambda^*T^*M \otimes E)\) and it's differential as \(d^{\nabla} (\omega \otimes \sigma) = d\omega \otimes \sigma + \omega \wedge \nabla \sigma\)

            To extend these concepts to line bundles \(L_0\), with a connection given by \(\nabla_{L_p} = \nabla^L _+ \nabla^{\delta_p}\), we have to restrict differential forms to \(P\). This is equivalent to say that \(\omega_p \in \Omega_k (M , L_p)\) is \(P\)-closed if
        </p>
        
        \[
        (d \nabla^{L_{P}} \omega_{P}) \bigg|_{p} = 0
        \]
        <p>
            and that it is \(P\)-exact if there exists an \(\alpha_p\) such that
        </p>
        
        \[
        \left(\omega_{P} - d^{\nabla^{L}_{P}}\alpha\right)|_{p} = 0
        \]

        <p>
            This is needed, basically, due to the fact that \(\nabla^{L}\) is not flat and that \(\nabla^{\delta_p}\) is ill defined. As P-exact forms are P-closed forms, we can define the cohomology group:
        </p>

        \[
        H^k(M, P, L_P) := \frac{\Omega_p^{k_{P\text{-closed}}}(M, P, L_P)}{\Omega_p^{k_{P\text{-exact}}}(M, P, L_P)}
        \]
        
        <p>
            These groups defines the cohomological wave functions, an even more refined idea of wave functions, as they compose a generalization of P-wave functions as discussed above.

            Lastly, we enter the step of quantization. More precisely, the step in which we construct the quantization map and operator \(Q\) and \(\hat{Q}\), respectively, using all the other results obtained so far. That being said, given \(f \in C^{\infty}(M)\) we define the quantization map using \(P\) as:
        </p>
        
        <div class="definition" text="Quantization Map">
            Given \(\tilde{\sigma} = \sigma \otimes \psi\) and \(L_{p} = L \otimes \delta_{P}\), we define the map \(Q_{f}: C^{\infty}(M) \to H^{0}(M, P, L_{P})\), as

            \[
            Q_{f}(\tilde{\sigma}) := P_{f}(\sigma) \otimes \psi + \sigma \otimes (-i\hbar L_{X_{f}} \psi)
            \] 
        </div>
        
            Which obeys the first four Dirac's quantization conditions, by construction. As a side note, we say that f is a quantizable function if \( [X, X_{f}] \in \Gamma(P)\), i.e., if the hamiltonian vector fields of \(f\) are polarization-preserving. Then we define a quantization operator as

            Finally, we define (summarize would be a better term, tbh) a canonical geometric quantization — and, consequently, all the results obtained so far — in the following theorem:
        
        <div class="theorem" text="Geometric Quantization">
            Suppose we have a sympletic manifold $(M, \omega)$, together with a prequantum line bundle \((L, \nabla)\), a polarization \(P\) and a bundle of half-forms \(\delta_P\). Denote \(\hat{\mathcal{H}} = H^{\bullet}(M,P,L_P)\) and \(C^\infty(M)_P\) the collection of functions whose hamiltonian vector fields are polarization-preserving. 
            
            Then, the map \(\hat{Q}_f: C^\infty(M) \rightarrow H^{\bullet}(M,P,L_P)\), as defined above, satisfies the first, second and fourth Dirac's quantization conditions. Moreover, the space of smooth polarized sections of \(L_p\), denoted by \(H^{0}(M,P,L_P)\), has a pairing that defines our volume form, i.e., 
            
            by \(\langle \tilde{\sigma}_1, \tilde{\sigma}_2\rangle_{L_P} = \langle \sigma_1, \sigma_2(\psi_1, \psi_2)\), and the map \(Q_f: C^\infty(M) \rightarrow H^{0}(M,P,L_P)\) as defined above satisfies the first four Dirac's quantization conditions with respect to this pairing.
